"""Universe-wide options scanner backing the Options Command Center page.

Every ranking here reads the LATEST persisted OptionsMetricsSnapshot row per
active US-market ticker (see app/models/options_metrics_snapshot.py) -- a
per-request live yfinance fetch across the whole universe would be far too
expensive, so this is intentionally a read of whatever has already been
captured by the nightly batch or by users viewing the single-symbol
dashboard. Coverage grows organically over time and can be sparse (e.g.
during the yfinance open-interest data gaps documented on
OptionsMetricsSnapshot) -- every ranking list may legitimately come back
shorter than its nominal "top 10", or empty, when too few symbols have the
fields that ranking needs.

The macro SPY/QQQ bar is the one exception: it's just two symbols, so
_fetch_live_macro_index does a live on-demand fetch when there's no usable
persisted snapshot, so the top bar stays populated regardless of universe
coverage.

Volatility Acceleration and Gamma Flip Proximity are a second exception:
they only need total_gex / flip level / spot, which the existing daily
max-pain -> GEX -> options pipeline (gex_tasks.py) already computes for
~10k tickers, independent of and far ahead of the much narrower
options-metrics batch sweep (analyze_options_exposure) that everything
else here depends on. Making those two tables wait on that sweep to
individually re-derive numbers the GEX pipeline already has would leave
them sitting near-empty for no reason -- so they read GexSnapshot directly
instead.

    fetch that got zeros back), which also collapses total_gex to 0 and can
    drag current_atm_iv down to a near-floor value that isn't a real market
